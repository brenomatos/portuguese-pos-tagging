Code regarding the second practical assignment from Natural Language Processing class @ UFMG.
The assignment was to do a POS-Tag on a brazillian portuguese database called MacMorpho
\n
To obtain the results, run 'python3 main.py'. You'll then have two files for each
model created: one is named like 'x-y.csv', being 'x' the sliding window size, and
'y' being the # of epochs. The other file starts is named like 'total_accuracy_x-y.txt',
with 'x' and 'y' having the same meaning as in the other file
